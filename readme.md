# additonal commands and description
git reflog:
Shows a history of all changes to HEAD ‚Äî even if you've moved branches or deleted commits.
Think of it like a "Git undo history".

git restore <file_name>:
Restores the working directory copy of a particular file from the latest commit.

git checkout HEAD:
Restores all files in the working directory to the last committed state (HEAD).

git checkout HEAD~2:
Checks out the commit that is 2 steps before HEAD. Puts you in detached HEAD state.

git rebase:
To avoid messy merge commits
To keep history clean and linear
To update your feature branch with the latest changes from main/master
